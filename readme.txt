In crafting the Connect Four Game, I aimed to deliver a captivating web-based rendition of the timeless Connect Four experience. Merging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I strived for a harmonious blend of aesthetics and functionality. The responsive design ensures players can enjoy the game seamlessly on diverse devices, underlining my commitment to a user-friendly interface.

The JavaScript code underpinning the game is meticulously structured and extensively commented, offering a transparent roadmap for developers. From managing disc placements and color transitions to handling win and draw scenarios, the logic is robust and adaptable. The player interface features dynamic updates, such as turn indications and vibrant animations, enhancing the overall gaming ambiance. With attention to detail, the project includes an engaging restart button, complete with interactive mouseover effects.
